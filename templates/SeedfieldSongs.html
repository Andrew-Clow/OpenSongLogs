    <h2>What's here</h2>
    <p>You can see the songs we've sung by Date, by Song name or by when the song was New, just click on the links below:</p>
        
			<%def name="headerLink(text,href)">
				&nbsp;
				<span class="clickable big">
					<a href="${href}">${text}</a>
				</span>
			</%def>
			% for linktext in linksOnHomepage.keys():
				${headerLink(linktext,links[linksOnHomepage[linktext]])}
			% endfor
	
	<p>When you see a number under "In the last", if you move your mouse over it or tap it, you'll get a list of when it's been used. The pages are quite slow to load because there's a lots of data on each page.</p>

    <p>These pages were created on ${today.isoformat()}.
    Ask Andrew to update the pages if they're out of date!</p>
	
	<h2>What's planned</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Put the book number next to the song number</li>
		<li>Allow you to click a song title to see the song text, possibly with the chords and other details omitted. Use password protection for this if its online.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What's done now</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>There's now a list of new songs that aren't in Songs of Fellowship.</li>
		<li>Also you can just show December songs in case you're looking for Christmas songs.</li>
		<li>Most of the missing services from 2012-2015 are now in, having transcribed an awful lot of orders of services I've hoarded in Word into OpenSong.</li>
		<li>It's now sortable by how often the songs have been used.</li>
		<li>The program now automatically translates songs without numbers into the same song in Songs of Fellowship if it's there. Notable exceptions are when there are different versions of the song.</li>
		<li>It now recognises Hymns&Psalms numbers as numbers.</li>
		<li>Separate out the numbers from the titles.</li>
		<li>Allow you to see all songs, even those we haven't used when you sort by songs.</li>
		<li>I've put it online - <a href="http://seedfieldsongs.orgfree.com/">https://seedfieldsongs.orgfree.com/</a></li>
