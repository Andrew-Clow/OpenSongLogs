# 1.1.0

## Refactored, reorganised etc

Wow, well that was a biggie!

* Split off website structure into where.py
* RelativeLocation helps calculate relative addresses for links
* gui is currently just a stub, don't get excited yet
* Reorganised so that individual pages and destinations can be done at will (which was needed before the gui can be useful
* Unified generation of lists of songs into songlists.py and generation of webpages into weboutput.py
* Now publishing full text search into songtext/SongSearch.html but **you should get yourself password protection on that subdirectory!** I used .htaccess and .htpasswd but of course they
re not in the repo!
