# Todo

* Implement sorting via javascript rather than multiple pages. It's not 1998.
* Make GUI so I can just output again without reloading
* Maybe add the feature of selectively recalculating lists. Probably hard because we need an audit trail of dependencies.
* Maybe add the feature of saving all lists to disk and reading at startup, offering recalc as default or option thereof.
